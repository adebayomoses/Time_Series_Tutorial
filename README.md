Time Series Tutorial for Beginners Using Store Sales Data Set
Welcome to the realm of Time Series!

One of the most prevalent real-world applications of machine learning is forecasting. Businesses forecast product demand, governments predict economic and population growth, and meteorologists forecast the weather. The need to comprehend future events is a significant demand spanning across various domains, from science and government to industry and our everyday lives. In response to this growing need, professionals in these fields are increasingly turning to machine learning as a solution.

Time series forecasting is a well-established discipline with a rich history. This course concentrates on the utilization of contemporary machine learning techniques for analyzing time series data, with the primary objective of generating highly accurate predictions. The course draws inspiration from successful solutions in past Kaggle forecasting competitions but remains relevant for any scenario where precision in forecasting is vital.

** Upon completing this, you will gain proficiency in time series:

1. Crafting features to model the key components of time series, including trends, seasons, and cycles.
2. Visualizing time series data through a variety of plots and graphs.
3. Developing forecasting hybrids that harness the strengths of complementary models.
4. Adapting machine learning methodologies to a wide range of forecasting challenges.

Let's delve into the fundamental concept: What is a Time Series

A time series is the cornerstone of forecasting, representing a collection of observations recorded over time. In forecasting applications, these observations are typically gathered at regular intervals, such as daily or monthly.
